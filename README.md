# Kali-Network-Pentesting-Tools
In this repo, I have included the tools that i used for my everyday penetration tests, if you have just installed kali and lost your tools, this is the right repo for you :)
```
git clone https://github.com/toneemarqus/Kali-Network-Pentesting-Tools.git
```
```
chmod +x prepare.sh 
```
./prepare.sh
```
The above script will update and upgrade kali, clean and install some tools.

The tools that are going to be installed are:
- gedit
- seclists
- gobuster
- go map exec
